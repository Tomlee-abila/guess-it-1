# Guess it 1

## Overview of the Program
The program reads numerical data from standard input, computes the average, variance, and standard deviation, and finally prints a confidence interval (Â± 2 times the standard deviation) around the average. The lower bound of the confidence interval is adjusted to 0 if it is negative.

How to Run the Program

1. The program doesn't accept any command-line arguments, but you can execute it as follows:
```bash
go run .
```
2. After running the program, provide numerical input interactively via the terminal.
